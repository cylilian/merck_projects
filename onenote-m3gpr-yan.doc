Oct 24 meeting with Zhiyuan
From Zhiyuan meeting Oct 24 
Old data of MK6070 from process 1 
New data (23) from process 2, varying concentration (potential task definition criteria), same feature same 
Answer the yes or no question for salt/sugar, switch from Sorbital to Sucrose (8% weight percentage), remove Glycine 
Batch Bayesian Optimization, batch recommendations 


Updates on obsidian library 
Summary: 
(1)Can not use command pip install obsidian to install the library, so I looked into the code in the repository 

(2)only has MOGP, not MTMO GP 

(3)the documentation is not complete 
Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO) Workflow 

Data 
Continuous: Minmax scaling 
Categorical: Label Encoding 


Surrogate Models: 
In training the Surrogate model, it utilizes the functions from both the gpytorch and the botorch libraries 
The type of GP models: 

GPflat: use BoTorch SingleTaskGP, no prior on noise, length scale 
GPprior: use BoTorch SingleTaskGP, has prior on noise, length scale 
Mixed GP: GP with mixed parameter types (continuous, categorical) 
MTGP: Multi-task GP for multi-output optimization, implemented as a multi-output GP 
DKL (Deep Kernel Learning): before feeding x into a GP kernel, first feed it through a feature extractor constructed by a NN 

DNN: implemented 

Acquisition function: 

Mostly use acquisitions functions from Botorch: 

"qProbabilityOfImprovement", 

"qUpperConfidenceBound",   

"qSimpleRegret", 

"qLogExpectedImprovement", 

"qLogNoisyExpectedImprovement", 

"qLogExpectedHypervolumeImprovement", 

"qLogNoisyExpectedHypervolumeImprovement", 

"qLogNParEGO", 

"qNegIntegratedPosteriorVariance" 

 

Besides, two custom acquisision functions were defined: 

(1)qMean: optimize for the maximum value of posterior mean 

(2)qSpaceFill: optimizes for the maximum value of minimum distance between a point and the training data 

 

There is a flag to indicate whether the output is multi-dimensional 

 

Objective function: 

Single-objective optimization: The optimal value of measured experimental outcome 

 

Multi-objective optimization:  

(1)optimal weighted outcome 

(2)hypervolume: first choose a reference point in the output space as a baseline, then the hypervolume is calculated for the space between the reference point and the pareto front 

(3)minimum distance to the utopian point
